#### Hi, I'm Hwiryung Kim Backend Developer & Simplicity
I'm a backed developer with a passion for crafting clean, efficient, and maintainable code with a strong foundation in Java and deep experties in the Spring Framework, I focus on building  systems that are not only robust and scalable, but also sustainable over time.


#### Problem Solver First
at my core, I'm a problem solver. I enjoy breaking down challenges into actionable tasks and iteating toward elegant, practical solutions. I continuously seek opportunities


#### Driven by Simplicity
One of my core development philosophies in the KISS principle: "Keep It Simple Stupid" <br>
I believe simplicity is not about writing less code it's about writing the right code
